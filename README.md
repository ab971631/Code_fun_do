<h1><strong>Idea:</strong><br></h1>
<h4>We are trying to detect disaster around the world and help people communicate for help at the time of disaster.<br>
We will use twitter for scraping old tweets during natural disaster for training the model and use it on the current tweets.<br>
People can put a list of their friends stuck in a disaster.<br>
We will plot a graph between disaster analysis against time<br>
we will use google map api to show the location of disaster area and specifications</h4>
